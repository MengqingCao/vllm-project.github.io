We are thrilled to announce the **alpha release of vLLM V1**, a major upgrade to vLLM’s core architecture. Based on lessons we learned over the past 1.5 years of vLLM development, we revisited key design decisions, consolidated various features, and simplified the codebase to enhance flexibility and scalability. V1 already achieves **state-of-the-art performance** and is set to gain even more optimizations. Best of all, users can enable V1 seamlessly—just set the `VLLM_USE_V1=1` environment variable **without any changes to the existing API**. After testing and feedback collection in the coming weeks, we plan to transition V1 into the default engine.

# Why vLLM V1?

## Learning from vLLM V0

Over the past 1.5 years, vLLM has achieved remarkable success in supporting diverse models, features, and hardware backends. However, while our community scaled horizontally, we faced challenges making the systems simple and integrating various optimizations vertically across the stack. Features were often developed independently, making it difficult to combine them effectively and cleanly. Over time, technical debt accumulated, prompting us to revisit our foundational design.

## Goals of V1

Based on the above motivation, vLLM V1 is designed to:  
- Provide a **simple, modular, and easy-to-hack codebase**.  
- Ensure **high performance** with near-zero CPU overhead.  
- **Combine key optimizations** into a unified architecture.  
- Require **zero configs** by enabling features/optimizations by default.

## Scope of V1

vLLM V1 introduces a comprehensive re-architecture of its core components, including the scheduler, KV cache manager, worker, sampler, and API server. However, it still shares a lot of code with vLLM V0, such as model implementations, GPU kernels, distributed control plane, and various utility functions. This approach allows V1 to leverage the extensive coverage and stability established by V0 while delivering significant enhancements to performance and code complexity.

# What’s New in vLLM V1?

## 1. Optimized Execution Loop & API Server

<p align="center">

</p>

As a full-fledged continuous batching engine and OpenAI-compatible API server, vLLM’s core execution loop relies on CPU operations to manage request states between model forward passes. As GPUs are getting faster and significantly reducing model execution times, the CPU overhead for tasks like running the API server, scheduling work, preparing inputs, de-tokenizing outputs, and streaming responses to users becomes increasingly pronounced. This issue is particularly noticeable with smaller models like Llama-8B running on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, where execution time on the GPU is as low as ~5ms.

In the [v0.6.0 release](https://blog.vllm.ai/2024/09/05/perf-update.html), vLLM introduced a multiprocessing API server utilizing ZeroMQ for IPC, enabling overlap between the API server and AsyncLLM. vLLM V1 extends this by integrating the multiprocessing architecture deeper into the core of AsyncLLM, creating an isolated `EngineCore` execution loop that focuses exclusively on the scheduler and model executor. This design allows for greater overlap of CPU-intensive tasks—such as tokenization, multimodal input processing, de-tokenization, and request streaming—with the core execution loop, thereby maximizing model throughput.

## 2. Simple & Flexible Scheduler

</p>

vLLM V1 introduces a simple yet flexible scheduler. It removes the traditional distinction between “prefill” and “decode” phases by treating user-given prompt tokens and model-generated output tokens uniformly. Scheduling decisions are represented as a simple dictionary, e.g., `{request_id: num_tokens}`, which specifies the number of tokens to process for each request at each step. We find that this representation is general enough to support features such as chunked prefills, prefix caching, and speculative decoding. For instance, chunked-prefill scheduling is seamlessly implemented: with a fixed token budget, the scheduler dynamically decides how many tokens to allocate to each request (as shown in the figure above).

## 3. Zero-Overhead Prefix Caching

vLLM V1, like V0, uses hash-based prefix caching and LRU-based cache eviction. In V0, enabling prefix caching sometimes causes significant CPU overhead, leading to rather decreased performance when the cache hit rate is low. As a result, it is disabled by default. In V1, we optimize the data structure for constant-time cache eviction and carefully minimize Python object creation overhead. This makes V1’s prefix caching introduce near-zero performance degradation, even when the cache hit rate is 0%. **Thanks to this change, we now enable prefix caching by default in V1.**

## 4. Clean Architecture for Tensor-Parallel Inference

</p>

vLLM V1 introduces a clean and efficient architecture for tensor-parallel inference, effectively addressing the limitations of V0. In V0, the scheduler and Worker 0 are colocated within the same process to reduce the inter-process communication overhead when broadcasting input data to workers. However, this design introduces an asymmetric architecture, increasing complexity. V1 overcomes this by caching request states on the worker side and transmitting only incremental updates (diffs) at each step. This optimization minimizes inter-process communication, allowing the scheduler and Worker 0 to operate in separate processes, resulting in a clean, symmetric architecture. Moreover, V1 abstracts away most distributed logic, enabling workers to operate the same way for both single-GPU and multi-GPU setups. 

## 5. Efficient Input Preparation

</picture>
</p>

In vLLM V0, input tensors and metadata for the model are recreated at each step, often leading to significant CPU overhead. To optimize this, V1 implements the [Persistent Batch](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy) technique, which caches the input tensors and only applies the diffs to them at each step. Additionally, V1 minimizes the CPU overheads in updating the tensors by extensively utilizing Numpy operations instead of Python's native ones.

## 6. torch.compile and Piecewise CUDA Graphs

<p align="center">

</picture>
</p>

V1 leverages vLLM’s `torch.compile` integration to automatically optimize the model. This allows V1 to efficiently support a wide variety of models while minimizing the need of writing custom kernels. Furthermore, V1 introduces *piecewise CUDA graphs* to alleviate the limitations of CUDA graphs. We are preparing dedicated blog posts on the torch.compile integration and piecewise CUDA graphs, so **stay tuned for more updates**!

## 7. Enhanced Support for Multimodal LLMs

vLLM V1 treats multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as first-class citizens and introduces several key improvements in their support.

First, V1 optimizes multimodal input preprocessing by moving it to a non-blocking process. For example, image files (e.g., JPG or PNG) must be converted into tensors of pixel values, cropped, and transformed before being fed into the model. This preprocessing can consume significant CPU cycles, possibly leaving the GPU idle. To address this, V1 offloads the preprocessing task to a separate process, preventing it from blocking the GPU worker, and adds a preprocessing cache so that processed inputs can be reused across requests if they share the same multimodal input.

Second, V1 introduces prefix caching for multimodal inputs. In addition to the hash of token IDs, image hashes are used to identify the KV cache for image inputs. This improvement is especially beneficial for multi-turn conversations that include image inputs.

Third, V1 enables chunked-prefill scheduling for MLLMs with the "encoder cache." In V0, image inputs and text inputs had to be processed in the same step because the LLM decoder’s <img> token depends on the vision embeddings which are discarded after the step. With the encoder cache, V1 temporarily stores the vision embeddings, allowing the scheduler to split the text inputs into chunks and process them across multiple steps without needing to regenerate vision embeddings every step.

## 8. FlashAttention 3

The final piece of the puzzle for vLLM V1 was integrating [FlashAttention 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08608). Given the high level of dynamism in V1—such as combining prefill and decode within the same batch—a flexible and high-performance attention kernel was essential. FlashAttention 3 effectively addresses this requirement, offering robust support for a wide range of features while maintaining excellent performance across diverse use cases.

# Performance

Thanks to the extensive architectural enhancements, vLLM V1 achieves state-of-the-art throughput and latency, delivering up to **x** higher throughput compared to V0 (*without multi-step scheduling*).
These dramatic performance gains stem from comprehensive CPU overhead reductions across the entire stack.
The improvements are even more pronounced for vision-language models (VLMs) like Qwen2-VL, thanks to V1's enhanced support for VLMs.

- **Llama 3.1 8B, 1xH100**

- **Llama 3.3 70B, 4xH100**

- **Qwen2-VL (VLM), 1xH100**


# Limitations & Future Work

While vLLM V1 shows promising results, it is still in its alpha stage and lacks several features from V0. Here’s a clarification:

**Model Support:**  
V1 supports decoder-only Transformers like Llama, mixture-of-experts (MoE) models like Mixtral, and several VLMs such as Qwen2-VL. All quantization methods are supported. However, V1 currently does not support encoder-decoder architectures like multimodal Llama 3.2, Mamba-based models like Jamba, or embedding models. Please check out [our documentation]() for a more detailed list of the supported models.

**Feature Limitations:**  
V1 currently lacks support for log probs, prompt log probs sampling parameters, pipeline parallelism, structured decoding, speculative decoding, prometheus metrics, and LoRA. We are actively working to close this feature gap and add new optimizations. Please stay tuned!

**Hardware Support:**  
V1 currently supports only Ampere or later NVIDIA GPUs. We are actively working to extend support to other hardware backends such as TPU.

Finally, please note that you can continue using V0 and maintain backward compatibility by not setting `VLLM_USE_V1=1`.

# How to Get Started

To use vLLM V1:  
1. Install the latest version of vLLM with `pip install vllm --upgrade`.  
2. **Set the environment variable `export VLLM_USE_V1=1`.**  
3. Use vLLM’s [Python API](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/main/examples/offline_inference/basic.py) or OpenAI-compatible server (`vllm serve <model-name>`). You don’t need any change to the existing API.
